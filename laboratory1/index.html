                <h3>Audrey Hepburn</h3>
                <p><b id="audrey">Audrey Hepburn</b> was an Academy-Award winning actress and a fashion icon in the 20th century. Having almost starved to death in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands during <mark>World War II</mark>, Hepburn became a goodwill ambassador for starving children.
                Considered one of the most beautiful and elegant women in the world then and now, Hepburn's beauty shone through her doe eyes and contagious smile. A trained ballet dancer who never performed in a ballet, Hepburn was Hollywood's most sought-after actress in the mid-20th century.</p>
